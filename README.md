# five-finger-exercises

This directory  contains examples  of code I  have written  in various
languages.  Some  of this  stuff works  directly on  downloading, some
not. It is provided for illustrative purposes rather than directly for
use.

 - CombinatorParser.R: A minimal monadic parser for R

 - HO: A Julia package for  generating optimal cross-hub schedules for
   the  combined  fleets of  an  airline  group, using  a  Multi-agent
   simulation,  with approximate  dynamic programming  / reinforcement
   learning.

 - HiearchicalRegressionDemo.R:  a  demonstration  I  constructed  for
   teaching  / illustrating  how  hierarchical  regression works.  The
   script here is in R, while the inlined model code is in Stan.

 - OptimalRouting.jl:  A  small  demo  using  the  Cbc  mixed  integer
   optimisation package  from inside Julia. Solves  the delivery truck
   fleet optimal routing problem.

 - ResourcePlanningDemo.hs: An implementation in  Haskell of the blood
   bank problem in Powell, Approximate Dynamic Programming.

 - Sudoko.py: A  solver for Sudoko  problems in python  - surprisingly
   compact, I think.

 - pentominos.jl: implementation  in Julia of Knuth's  dancing links /
   Algorithm X solution of the  exact cover problem.  Set up currently
   to enumerate  complets solution sets for  pentomino problems, which
   is does extremely fast.
